# GWTC-3 Contour Plotter

This app reproduces contour plots from the GWTC-3 catalog paper. 

Run the app in streamlit: [gwtc3-contours.streamlit.app/](https://gwtc3-contours.streamlit.app/).

## About this app 

**What is GWTC-3?** GWTC-3 is the "third gravitational wave transient catalog" from the [LIGO](https://www.ligo.org/), [Virgo](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/), and [KAGRA](https://gwcenter.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) (LVK) Collaborations. [GWTC-3](https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-O3bCatalog/) updates the previous catalogs ([GWTC-1](https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-O2Catalog/), [GWTC-2](https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-O3aCatalog/), [GWTC-2.1](https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-O3aFinalCatalog/)) with merger events observed during the second part of Observing Run 3 (O3b), which lasted from the 1st November 2019 to the 27th March 2020.

This streamlit app reproduces figures 8 and 9 from the [GWTC-3 catalog paper](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2000318/public) using material from the [GWTC-3 parameter estimation data release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5546662). You can select which events to plot and highlight interactively.
